# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program to see if members of the program provide biased reviews.

## Results:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  * Paid: 1207
  * Unpaid: 97839
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  * Paid: 509 
  * Unpaid: 45858 
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary

We can conclude that members of the Amazon Vine program do not provide biased reviews because 42% of their reviews are 5 stars, whereas 47% of unpaid reviews are 5 stars.

Additional statistical analysis could be conducted to factor in the distribution of reviews as well as apply NLP.
